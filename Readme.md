<h2>Preparation</h2>
<p>The 16 tiles are place open on the board (table) in ascending order.
The startplayer recieves all 8 dice.</p>


<h2>Rules of the game</h2>
<p>Taking turns each player tries to earn a tile by means of the dice. Each player stacks his/her tiles in front of him in order. The last earnt tile will be placed on top. The tile on top is the only tile which maybe taken by the other players.</p>

<h2>Rules of a turn</h2>
<p> A turn goes a follows:
<ul>
  <li>The player throws a 8 dice.</li>
  <li>The player chooses one of the thrown symbols (a value or the lumbricidae) and puts all dice with this symbol aside.</li>
  <li>The player may repeat the throwing en putting aside a number of times, each time with the remaining dice. After each throw the player nust put dice aside to throw again or take a tile. The player must however choose a different value or symbol every time. A symbol which is already put aside may not be choosen again.</li>
  <li>As soon as the player can take a tile, he/she can end his/her turn, but the player can also try his/her luck to get a tile with a higher number of lumbricidae or a tile from another player.</li>
  <li>The player takes a tile and puts it on top of his/her own stack, or he has to turn in the top tile of his/her stack.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>End of a turn</h3>
<p>A turn can end in two ways:
<ol>
  <li>The player can only take a tile if there is at least one lumbricidae put aside, and the total value of the dice put aside has a <b>minimum</b> of the lowest value of a tile on the board, or <b>exactly</b> equal to the value of a tile from another player. A lumbricidae has a value of 5.
  <ul>
    <li>If a tile with the value is <b>exactly</b> equal to the total value is present in the row on the board or the top one from another player it can be taken.</li>
    <li>If this is not the case (or the player does not see that other players have this tile), the player may take the first closest tile with a lower number from the table.</li>
    <li>The player puts the taken tile on tip of his own stack: Only the top tile can be taken by other players.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If the player can not put dice aside after his throw (every symbol has already been put aside before), or all dice a put aside but the conditions to take a tile do not apply, then the player must (if he/she has any) put back a tile.
  <ul>
    <li>The player takes the top tile of his/her stack and puts it open at the correct place in the ordered row on the board.</li>
    <li>The player turns the tile with the highest value in the open row on the board. This tile will not participate in the game anymore. Note: if the tile which is put back in the row has the highest value it will not be turned.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
</p>

<h2>End of the game</h2>
<p>
When there are no more open tiles on the board the game ends. Each playermcounts the number of lumbricidae on his/her tiels. The player with the most lumbricidae wins.</p>
